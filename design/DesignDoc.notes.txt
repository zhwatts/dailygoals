    Premise         :
        An app where a user can add tasks they have completed through out the day, and add how much time was spent on the task
        an example would be a pomodoro timer with built in task listing

    - Start a new "focus round" on that task
        > Should be able to perform subsequent focus rounds on that task with single click
    - should be able to add blocks of time to the task outside of focus periods
    - should be able to track breaks and distractions
    - should be able to run reports of total time tracked, and percent of time allocated to what task
    - should be able to add points to a task if the user does not know how much time was spent, or was multi tasking
    - should be able to enter "multi task" periods, where each selected "multi task" divides the amount of time specified

- limit number of tasks per day, forward all past that limit to next day
- have emergency priority button
- click timer to toggle between count up and count down displays
